Social Media Platform using MERN Stack
This project is a social media platform developed with the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js). It enables users to create accounts, post content, interact with posts through likes and comments, and follow other users. The frontend is built using React.js with Redux for state management, ensuring a responsive and interactive user interface. The backend, powered by Node.js and Express.js, handles user authentication via JWT tokens and manages data persistence in MongoDB using Mongoose for schema validation. The platform supports real-time updates using Socket.IO, enhancing user engagement with instant notifications. To get started, clone the repository, set up environment variables for MongoDB URI and JWT secret, install dependencies with npm, and run the development server locally. Contributions are welcomeâ€”fork the repo, create a feature branch, make your changes, and submit a pull request following our guidelines in the Contributing section.
